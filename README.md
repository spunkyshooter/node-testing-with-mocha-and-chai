# node-testing-with-mocha-and-chai

Learnt and implemented unit testing using mocha framework and chai assertion library.

Experimented with TDD and BDD styles.

TDD style. (Test driven development)
 - Can't be chained.
 - Hard to communicate with the stake holders.

BDD style. ( behaviour driven development)
- Can be chained and easier to communicate with product owner (stake holders)
- Hence iterates faster in SDLC;

TIPS:
 - Don't use big fat arrow functions. (anonymous functions)
